Linux Scripts for Administration and Auditing
I have no idea what I am doing and hope to remedy that shortly. This is my first github repository.
The purpose of this is to develop simple administration and auditing tools for Linux. I am using CentOS 7. YMMV
Standard disclaimer: don't run any scripts you don't understand. That's my job.
